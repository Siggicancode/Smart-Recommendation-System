# Smart-Recommendation-System
This "Smart Recommendation System" was built in Node-RED to give the user clothing recommendations on the smartphone based on temperature and pressure data from a BMP280-Sensor through a Microcontroller (Elegoo Uno). It was created for a project in my studies of economical engineering in the module "Smart Devices" at "IU Internationale Hochschule".

In this Repository I append a JASON file which has to be imported into Node-RED.

Prerequisits:
- Node-RED (local installation)
- Arduino Uno (or comparable Microcontroller that is compatible with Node-RED)
- BMP280 sensor from Bosch
- Remote-RED App (subscription)

After the Import of the FLow Node-RED will give you an overview of the missing dependencies and Nodes that have to be installed.

There is a Testkit within the Flow that can be used to test the functionality of the flow.

If there are any questions or discrepancies feel free to contact me.

Regards
