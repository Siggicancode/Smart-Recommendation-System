# Smart-Recommendation-System
This "Smart Recommendation System" was built in Node-RED to give the user clothing recommendations based on temperature and pressure data from a BMP280-Sensor through a Microcontroller (Elegoo Uno). It was created for a project in my studies of economical engineering in the module "Smart Devices" at "IU Internationale Hochschule".

In this Repository I appendet a JASON file which has to be imported into Node-RED.

After the Import Node-RED will give you an overview of the missing dependencies and Nodes that have to be installed.

There is a Testkit within the Flow that can be used to test the functionality of the flow.

If there are any questions or discrepancies feel free to contact me.

Regards
